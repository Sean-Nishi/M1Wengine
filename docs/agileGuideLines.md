# Agile Guidelines

The story point estimates for this project will follow a fibonacci sequence to differentiate level of work estimates as follows:

## 1 Point
An estimation of one (1) point indicates a very small issue. In general, an estimation of 1 point indicates an issue which should be first considered as a sub-task.
### Consideration Questions
- Does this issue pertain to another larger story on the board? If so, can this be added as a sub-task?
- Will this issue require a code-review process? If so, it is likely that a larger story point estimate shall be used to account for code-review time and the uncertainty of potentially requested changes.
Development time (including testing and code-review)
- 0 – 2 hours
### Examples
- Small documentation change
- Typo fixes or formatting changes with no logic changed
- Dedicated code review period
 
## 2 Points
An estimation of two (2) points indicates a small issue.
### Consideration Questions
- Does this issue require changes to relevant documentation? If so, has the relative estimate of the documentation changes been accounted for?
Development time (including testing and code-review)
- 2 – 4 hours
### Examples
- Minor bug fix
- Update dependency and check for incompatibilities
- Expand GitHub actions for additional release files
- Changing simple logic, includes time to design, implement, test, review
 
## 3 Points
An estimation of three (3) points indicates a small-medium issue.
### Consideration Questions
- Does this issue require changes to relevant documentation? If so, has the relative estimate of the documentation changes been accounted for?
Development time (including testing and code-review)
- 4 – 8 hours
### Examples
- Complex logic changes, design, implement, test, review
- Upgrading documentation format
- Implementing movement behavior of new entity

## 5 Points
An estimation of five (5) points indicates a medium issue.
### Consideration Questions
- Are there any elements which can be split to sub-tasks or separate issues? If so, be sure to appropriately update the relative estimates for each.
- Does this issue require changes to relevant documentation? If so, has the relative estimate of the documentation changes been accounted for?
Development time (including testing and code-review)
- 8 – 16 hours
### Examples
- Implementing new item,  designing/implementing interactions with other entities, adding animations, testing implementation, code review
- Designing a new complex level, implementing/testing the level, testing, code review

## 8 Points
An estimation of eight (8) points indicates a medium-large issue.
### Consideration Questions
- Are there any elements which can be split into sub-tasks or separate issues? If so, be sure to appropriately update the relative estimates for each.
- Does this issue require changes to relevant documentation? If so, has the relative estimate of the documentation changes been accounted for?
Development time (including testing and code-review)
- 16 – 32 Hours
### Examples
- Designing a new boss entity

## 13 Points
An estimation of thirteen (13) points indicates a large issue.
### Consideration Questions
- Are there any elements which can be split into sub-tasks or separate issues? If so, be sure to appropriately update the relative estimates for each.
Development Time (Including Testing and Code-Review)
- 32 - 40 Hours
### Examples
- Designing multiple levels, implementing multiple levels
- Designing a specification
- Integrate a complex library, such as tile parser

## 21 Points
An estimation of twenty-one (21) points indicates an extra-large issue.
### Consideration Questions
- Are there any elements which can be split into sub-tasks or separate issues? If so, be sure to appropriately update the relative estimates for each.
Development Time (including testing and code-review)
- 40+ Hours
### Examples
- Design a second game
