# Licensing Plans

The project will be open source with a licensing agreement stating Permission must be asked of Sean or Oliver if the intention is to sell the modified version. The general guidelines when giving permission will be that the code base can be used without our visual assets if the other project sufficiently modified the code to our personal standards.

If no money is made off this code, anyone can freely use it but not distribute it. The purpose of this is to ensure all users of this code base have reviewed our license and asked for permission if necessary.

MIT license will be used for the core project
Closed source will be used for the IP protected enhancements
