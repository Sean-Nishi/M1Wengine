# Guidelines for the workday
## Morning Standup
- What was accomplished yesterday
- What is the focus for today
- Brief overview on what is the planned implementation on issues
    - Allows discussion of ideas for improvement

## Push all code worked on to github before the afternoon review

## Afternoon review
- Were there any issues that came up?
- How many story points were finished?
- Did the issue scope make sense for the work involved?
- Do the issues need to be adjusted in scope?
- Do new issues need to be created?
- 1-2 things that went poorly.
- 1 thing that went well.

# Guidelines for the sprint
## Sprint planning
- Identify missing issues in the backlog
- Prioritize the backlog for the next sprint
- Assign story points for the following sprint
    - For each issue, walk through a high level overview of the issue to sync expectations
    - Identify all potential blockers per issue
    - Ensure the scope of each story point is correct per issue
- Discuss any weekly scheduling changes outside of the norm

## Sprint RetroSpective
- All story points assigned at the beginning of each sprint should be done by the end of the sprint
    - When this is not the case do the following:
        - Break apart the story points that were not finished
        - Was the scope incorrect?
        - Was there a blocker?
        - Was there another reason the story point was not finsihed?
