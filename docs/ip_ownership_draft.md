# Reluctant Hero Ownership Draft

IP Ownership of the reluctant Hero will be split between Sean Nishi and Oliver Walker according to the story points of work completed by the time the game is profitable.
If the story points completed by each are 50% of the total story points, the Ownership will be split in half, otherwise, the ownership will reflect the percentage of total story points completed per individual.

Story point calculations should not include closed issues that were not worked on.

Shared tasks will have the story points counted twice, once per individual who worked on the task.

Issues that are not linked to a pull request should be reviewed when calculating ownership.
